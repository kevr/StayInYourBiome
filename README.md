StayInYourBiome
---------------

A mod that stops creature spawns tied to existing global boss keys.

For example: In vanilla, when Yagluth is killed on a server, Fulings begin spawning at night time in the Meadows, Black Forest and Mountain. With *StayInYourBiome*, these Fulings only ever spawn in the Plains biome, their natural home.

This mod *does not* affect spawns having to do with raids. If you wish to limit raids, look into the Player-based Raids world modifier for Valheim.
